# CarTracker

This system grew out of my need to keep a car logbook for tax purposes. I need to record every car journey's distance and purpose.

## Components

* Raspberry Pi
* USB LTE Modem
* gpsd compatible GPS Data Logger (e.g. Holux M-1000C)
* OBD II bluetooth module

## Is it legal?

I'm not sure, time will tell. I think so, as per ATO finding [2002/095](http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=AID/AID2002925/00001).
