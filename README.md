# CarTracker

This is a bundle of scripts that cause a Raspberry Pi + GPS data logger combo in my car to log to a sensible location. This is very very alpha, I'm just tinkering for now.

* Holux M-1000C GPS Data Logger

## Instructions

### Server

You're on your own, just host the PHP file

### Client

#### Install the packages:

`sudo apt install -y gpsd gpsd-clients`
